 * Which runtime permissions are needed to scan for / connect to BLE heart-rate straps

 *
 * - Android 12+ (API 31+) introduced the dedicated `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`/`BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`
 *   runtime permissions.
 * - Everything before that — including this project's actual target hardware, the Bike Gen 2
 *   tablet on Android 10/API 29 or Android 11/API 30 — needs the legacy `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` runtime
 *   permission (BLE scans can reveal location on these API levels); `BLUETOOTH`/
 *   `BLUETOOTH_ADMIN` are also required there but are install-time "normal" permissions
 *   (declared in the manifest with `maxSdkVersion="30"`, never requested at runtime).
 *
 * A plain function of [sdkInt] (not `Build.VERSION.SDK_INT` read directly) so the branch is
 * unit-testable on a plain JVM without Robolectric.
