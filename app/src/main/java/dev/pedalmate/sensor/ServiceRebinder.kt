/**
 * Schedules re-binds of an affernet service binding with capped exponential backoff.
 *
 * When the affernet process is force-stopped, crashes or is updated, Android reports
 * `onBindingDied` and — unlike after `onServiceDisconnected` — never reconnects that binding on
 * its own: the client has to `unbindService` and bind again. A service that hands back a null
 * binder (`onNullBinding`) is likewise stuck until rebound. The Bike+ data source uses this to
 * retry at [initialDelayMs], doubling up to [maxDelayMs], so a service that is mid-restart is
 * not hammered and one that is down for a while is still picked up within [maxDelayMs].
 *
 * Retries run on [handler] (the main looper by default — the same thread `ServiceConnection`
 * callbacks arrive on).
